#Oasis Infobyte
Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains three data science projects completed during the Oasis Infobyte virtual internship. Each project demonstrates skills in data analysis, model building, and visualization using Python.

1.Email Spam Detection
Goal: To classify text messages as either spam or ham (not spam).
Methodology: A machine learning model (Logistic Regression) was trained on a dataset of messages. It achieved a high accuracy of 97.85%.
Key Insight: The model was tuned to be highly effective at catching spam, with a Spam Recall of over 91%, which is crucial for a real-world application.

2.Car Price Prediction
Goal: To predict the selling price of used cars.
Methodology: A regression model was trained to learn the relationship between a car's features (like age and mileage) and its price. The model achieved a high R 2 Score of 95.81%, indicating it can explain a large portion of the price variation.
Key Insight: The project shows how to build an accurate predictive model that can be used to estimate a fair price for a used car.

3.Unemployment Analysis
Goal: To visualize and understand unemployment trends across India.
Methodology: This project is focused on data analysis and visualization rather than a predictive model. It uses plots like heatmaps and bar charts to show key trends.
Key Insight: The analysis clearly visualizes the difference in unemployment rates between states, as well as the trend over time, which can be used to understand the impact of events like the Covid-19 pandemic.
